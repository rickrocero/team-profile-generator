# Team Profile Generator

## Description
My motivation for this project was to build a command-line application that takes accepts user input then generates a webpage with their information such as email address, github username, and employee info. I built this project to utilize node.js, the Inquirer package, and the Jest package for managers that can use to input, display, and have quick access to their team's basic info. This command-line application solves the problem of losing track of a team member's basic info. This project taught me about test-driven development, the jest package, and the inquirer.prompt method.
